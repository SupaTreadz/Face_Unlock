I made a facial recognition door lock system! It uses a raspi camera, raspberry pi 4, arduino uno, adafruit max98357 amp, speaker, and servo motor.

The facial recognition sensor code was modified from the amazing tutorial here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/

All of the setup steps I copied from my bash history file are located here: https://github.com/SupaTreadz/Face_Unlock/blob/master/setup_commands.txt
